This is a toy pogramming language.

### Example
`helloworld`
```cpp
declare putchar(int c) -> int
putchar("H")
putchar("e")
putchar("l")
putchar("l")
putchar("o")
putchar(",")
putchar(" ")
putchar("W")
putchar("o")
putchar("r")
putchar("l")
putchar("d")
putchar("!")
putchar("\n")

```

### Develop
`linux` & `windows`
```console
mkdir obj
make
./cloud example/helloworld.cd -v
```

### Goals
As simple as Python but as fast as CPlusPlus.

#### Thanks to @Akuli, the "jou" programming language really inspired me a lot.
#### And this project is almost based on the "jou" programming language.
